Adavanced Data Analysis Project --- Music Recommendation 
======================

# 1.Topic Selection

    We now have 5 topics:

### a.Music Recommendation

Now, musical gatekeepers have been replaced with personalizing algorithms and unlimited streaming services. While the public’s now listening to all kinds of music, algorithms still struggle in key areas. Without enough historical data, how would an algorithm know if listeners will like a new song or a new artist? And, how would it know what songs to recommend brand new users?

WSDM has challenged the Kaggle ML community to help solve these problems and build a better music recommendation system. The dataset is from KKBOX, Asia’s leading music streaming service, holding the world’s most comprehensive Asia-Pop music library with over 30 million tracks. They currently use a collaborative filtering based algorithm with matrix factorization and word embedding in their recommendation system but believe new techniques could lead to better results.

### b.Visitors Prediction

One common predicament for a thriving local restaurant is that restaurants need to know how many customers to expect each day to effectively purchase ingredients and schedule staff members. Recruit Holdings has unique access to key datasets that could make automated future customer prediction possible. Specifically, Recruit Holdings owns Hot Pepper Gourmet (a restaurant review service), AirREGI (a restaurant point of sales service), and Restaurant Board (reservation log management software).

In this competition, you're challenged to use reservation and visitation data to predict the total number of visitors to a restaurant for future dates. This information will help restaurants be much more efficient and allow them to focus on creating an enjoyable dining experience for their customers.

### c.Safe Driver Prediction

In this competition, you’re challenged to build a model that predicts the probability that a driver will initiate an auto insurance claim in the next year. While Porto Seguro has used machine learning for the past 20 years, they’re looking to Kaggle’s machine learning community to explore new, more powerful methods. A more accurate prediction will allow them to further tailor their prices, and hopefully make auto insurance coverage more accessible to more drivers.

### d.Mercari Price Suggestion

Mercari, Japan’s biggest community-powered shopping app, knows this problem deeply. They’d like to offer pricing suggestions to sellers, but this is tough because their sellers are enabled to put just about anything, or any bundle of things, on Mercari's marketplace.

In this competition, Mercari’s challenging you to build an algorithm that automatically suggests the right product prices. You’ll be provided user-inputted text descriptions of their products, including details like product category name, brand name, and item condition.

### e.Food Classification

Some of our strongest geographic and cultural associations are tied to a region's local foods. This playground competitions asks you to predict the category of a dish's cuisine given a list of its ingredients. 

## f.TensorFlow Speech Recognition Challenge
[Kaggle Link](https://www.kaggle.com/c/tensorflow-speech-recognition-challenge)

TensorFlow recently released the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people. 

In this competition, you're challenged to use the Speech Commands Dataset to build an algorithm that understands simple spoken commands. By improving the recognition accuracy of open-sourced voice interface tools, we can improve product effectiveness and their accessibility.

    Now, we pick Music Recommendation as our topic!
